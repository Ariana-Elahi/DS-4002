## Hypothesis
1/3 of the UVA undergraduate students will respond `yes` to the question "Is a hot dog a sandwich?" 
## Data Collection Process
Our data collection process had 3 main steps. First, we created a Google Forms Survey with two main questions asking about each respondent's UVA student status as well as his or her opinion on whether a hot dog is a sandwich. Next, each member of the class -- around 20-30 students -- circulated this form in an attempt to recieve as many responses as possible within a seven day time frame. Finally, this data was compiled into an excel spreadsheet for further analysis.

### Data Context Narrative
We collected data in order to determine whether undergraduate students at UVA believe that hotdogs are sandwiches.  In our survey, we found that 65.4% of respondents thought hotdogs were not sandwiches and 35.5% of respondents believed hotdogs were sandwiches. This is significant because there is no consensus among the subjects of our study - UVA undergraduate students - that one stance is valid - a hot dog is a sandwich - over the other - a hot dog is not a sandwich. Being able to settle the debate about this question is essential to be able to have a decisive answer. It helps people understand how we define specific categories, hot dogs and sandwiches, and the specific characteristics that go with each category. Furthermore, it will aid reputable sources like Merriam-Webster to have a more definitive answer so that these types of sources do not continue to have conflicting answers/opinions but rather facts.
