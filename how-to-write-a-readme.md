## general template

Name of project (big header, like H1)

One sentence description of what it does, two sentences at most. If you have screenshots of your thing running or of its output, put them here.

Installation/Building (H2)

Show the actual commands I have to type to build the project, including fetching dependencies. Use Markdown triple-backticks ("```") to show commands in code style.

Usage (H2)

If it's a command-line app, list the available invocations (e.g. git revert, git commit, etc.). If it's a web app, list the URLS.

Notes (H2)

This is where you talk about your design ideas: algorithms, papers you've read, goals, TODO items.
