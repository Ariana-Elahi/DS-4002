Likewise, an open-faced turkey sandwich (typically turkey and gravy, occasionally with mashed potatoes, on top of a slice of bread), despite its name, is not a sandwich, due to it being placed atop the bread, and not betwixt. The filling debate is also a non-starter. Peanut butter and jelly sandwiches are undoubtedly sandwiches despite a lack of meat and cheese. Therefore, there is no comparable example of a sandwich, or non-sandwich that would disqualify the hot dog from being considered a sandwich. The better question is, is a gyro a sandwich? What about a taco? What determines if the bread counts as bread? Does the bread require leavening to make it a sandwich or is a flour tortilla sufficient? These are the real questions that we can use to determine the true reaches of the sandwich definition. As for who knows this, maybe only God himself.'\n",
