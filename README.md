# Syllabus DS 4002: Data Science Project Course

## Instructor information

## Course Description / A little bit about this course
Hello there, have you ever … 
* ... been part of a group project that was a spectacular failure? 
* ... struggled to explain a data informed insight to a general audience? 
* ... failed to appropriately address bias in a data informed project? 

In DS 4002 we will tackle all of these challenges together. We will go boldly, make mistakes, and learn from those mistakes. 

This class is structured around three repetitions of a data science project workflow but with a different constraint on the data every time so that no two projects are alike. You will work in groups and everyone will have the challenge of leading their group for a project cycle. Along the way we will conduct self-assessments and work on individual development plans. The class begins by going over fundamental moves of data science group projects and transforms into a flipped environment where the majority of class time is for group work. The final assignment for the course is an individual case study expression of one project you worked on and is a great way to show off what you are capable of to that perspective employer.

# What previous students have said about DS 4002
> This was super cool to me because before this project, I had never worked with image data before and didn’t realize it was so readily available and so easy to work with. 

> I am very nervous about the workforce, what if I am not good enough or don’t know enough? Gaining more knowledge on different types of models is helping me ease that anxiety.

> There was a lot of communication faults from all of us. When we are in the industry, these issues don’t just slide. In a classroom, where we are here to learn, This is the best time to work on teamwork. Although this is can be uncomfortable let’s not worry make mistakes and focus on growing from those mistakes.
