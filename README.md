# Syllabus DS 4002: Data Science Project Course
*Create a positive and challenging environment ...

... make a commitment to each other and ourselves ...

... make the hard choices.*

**Compassion** &nbsp;&nbsp; **Selflessness** &nbsp;&nbsp;   **Commitment** &nbsp;&nbsp;   **Resilience** &nbsp;&nbsp;  **Work Ethic**


## Coach information

In this class your professor is actually your coach:

    * Professor Peter Alonzi (lpa2a)
    * Class Location: Time = MWF 13:00-13:50; Space = Dell 1, room 105
    * Office Hours: Elson 185A, time tbd

## Course Description / A little bit about this course
Hello there, have you ever … 
* ... been part of a group project that was a spectacular failure? 
* ... struggled to explain a data informed insight to a general audience? 
* ... failed to appropriately address bias in a data informed project? 

In DS 4002 we will tackle all of these challenges together. We will go boldly, make mistakes, and learn from those mistakes. 

This class is structured around three repetitions of a data science project workflow but with a different constraint on the data every time so that no two projects are alike. You will work in groups and everyone will have the challenge of leading their group for a project cycle. Along the way we will conduct self-assessments and work on individual development plans. The class begins by going over fundamental moves of data science group projects and transforms into a flipped environment where the majority of class time is for group work. The final assignment for the course is an individual case study expression of one project you worked on and is a great way to show off what you are capable of to that perspective employer. 

## Statment on JEDI [inherited from school of data science]
tbd: this comes from my school, we are workin on a  new plan to build continuity across our curriculum, stay tuned. n.b. the JEDI parts are above the fold, all the rest at the end

# What previous students have said about DS 4002
> This was super cool to me because before this project, I had never worked with image data before and didn’t realize it was so readily available and so easy to work with. 

> I am very nervous about the workforce, what if I am not good enough or don’t know enough? Gaining more knowledge on different types of models is helping me ease that anxiety.

> There was a lot of communication faults from all of us. When we are in the industry, these issues don’t just slide. In a classroom, where we are here to learn, This is the best time to work on teamwork. Although this is can be uncomfortable let’s not worry make mistakes and focus on growing from those mistakes.

## Course Objectives / What you'll learn along the way 
Data Science is a broad, elusive, and dynamic field best learned via hands-on experience. Topics in this course are selected to reinforce this perspective and help students understand the field’s core ideas and what is demanded from practicing data scientists. An ideal outcome would be for students to gain a perspective on the breadth of the field of data science, understand important tools and environments, and develop skills necessary to contribute to the community. Learning objectives include:

As a **group** we will all:
1. List, define, and explain the stages of the data science pipeline 
2. Identify your strengths and weaknesses as a team member 
3. Evaluate group performance 
4. Transform your findings into a Case Study for broad accessibility   

**Individually** you will select items to improve on, e.g. "I want to learn how to train a convolutional neural network (CNN)":
1. Student created Data Science Learning Objective #1 
2. Student created Data Science Learning Objective #2 
3. Student created Data Science Learning Objective #3
1. Student created Team Member Learning Objective #1 
2. Student created Team Member Learning Objective #2 
3. Student created Team Member Learning Objective #3

**N.B.** *If this seems like a lot of objectives ... you're not wrong. You are going to learn and change a lot in this course. But The reason for 3 of each type is because we do 3 repititions of the project cycle. Each Cycle you will pick 1 Data Science objective to learn and 1 Team Member objective to learn*

## Assessment / How you'll know you're learning
In this class the professor assigns assessments that are formative in nature. Each one is crafted to help focus your attention, perform, and reflect, with the aim of growing. There are three major categories of assessments:

1. Group Project Milestones - These milestones are related to steps in the Data Science Pipeline (e.g. establish your data set). As a result they are all different. For each a rubric is provided to guide your work. The rubrics are not set in stone, they are where the conversation begins, the specifics of your projects will pull the rubrics to where they need to be. These milestones are completed by your group and consitute the "C-Bundle" (details on grading are below).
2. Self-Assessments - The next level of work in this course focuses on your ability to assess yourself. Teammates and the professor will help, but ultimately it is your responsibility to take responsibility for your performance. This is very challenging. Many students over-estimate themselves **AND** many students under-estimate themselves. Cutting through the many factors that make up your performance requires practice, and we strive to make this course a place where that can happen. These assignments constitute the "B-Bundle".
3. Case Study Work - The final type of assignment involves transforming your work to reach a broad audience. In your case study work you will work to bring one of your projects from the term into a format that a wide audience can understand. (This course is 4000, so we will broaden to 2nd year's at UVA). You will read and reflect on Case Studies produced in this class in prior terms and your final assignment of the term will be to create your own Case Study. These assignments consitute the "A-Bundle".

### Evaluation / Because the University makes us use letter grades 
This course uses a grading system that is considered non-traditional in the United States. It is called Specifications Grading. If you have not used this system before it can be challenging to wrap your head around. We will spend time in class and in office hours getting on the same page. Please trust me that once we get in sync it can be quite liberating. If you are curious about the theory of the system see _Specifications Grading_ By Linda Nilson and check out the information presented by the Center For Teaching Excellence at UVA ([link](https://cte.virginia.edu/blog/2020/12/04/alternative-grading-practices-support-both-equity-and-learning))
